Foreword
=========

This code is based on Caffe and please ensure caffe is installed correctly in your computer.


Simple test version
=======

This is a lite code which you can use as an example to perform super-resolution on your own image and we provide our well-trainded model mentioned in the paper in this part. 


Training
========

We provide all the files used for training the edge weighted SR network in this part.
(We will upload it soon)

Testing
========

We provide all the testing codes including SR image producing, PSNR and OCR accuracy calculation as well as implement of proposed padding method in this part.
